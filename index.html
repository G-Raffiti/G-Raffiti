          <h4>Hello there!</h4>
          <p>I'm John, a passionate and driven game developer with a love for creative art. My journey with programming began in 2020 when I stumbled upon Unity, and it was love at first sight. For the next two years, I immersed myself in the world of game development, following online tutorials, and learning C#. Though I didn't complete any projects during that time, the knowledge I gained was a solid foundation for my future endeavors.</p>

          <h4>Diverse Skill Set</h4>
          <p>One thing that sets me apart is my diverse skill set. While exploring the world of code, I also discovered my talent for digital art and e-painting. The thrill of seeing my drawings come alive on the screen when imported into the games I create is incredibly fulfilling. The ability to marry programming and art allows me to craft immersive gaming experiences that leave a lasting impact on players.</p>
          <p>My journey took an unexpected turn when I worked as a barman at a board game bar. It was there that I joined an association of game creators, opening the door to new insights into game design and prototyping. This experience enriched my understanding of the gaming industry as a whole and reinforced my passion for building captivating games.</p>
