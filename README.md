# About Me:
### Hello there!
I'm Raphael, a passionate and driven game developer with a love for creative art. My journey with programming began in 2020 when I stumbled upon Unity<img alt="Unity" height="20px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Unity_2021.svg/2560px-Unity_2021.svg.png#gh-light-mode-only" />, and it was love at first sight. For the next two years, I immersed myself in the world of game development, following online tutorials, and learning <img alt="C#" width="20px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/csharp/csharp-original.svg" />. Though I didn't complete any projects during that time, the knowledge I gained was a solid foundation for my future endeavors.


### Diverse Skill Set
One thing that sets me apart is my diverse skill set. While exploring the world of code, I also discovered my talent for digital art and e-painting (mostly in Krita <img alt="Krita" width="20px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Krita_Application_Logo.svg" /> and Photshop <img alt="Photoshop" width="20px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Adobe_Photoshop_CC_icon.svg" />). The thrill of seeing my drawings come alive on the screen when imported into the games I create is incredibly fulfilling. The ability to marry programming and art allows me to craft immersive gaming experiences that leave a lasting impact on players.

My journey took an unexpected turn when I worked as a barman at a board game bar. It was there that I joined an association of game creators, opening the door to new insights into game design and prototyping. This experience enriched my understanding of the gaming industry as a whole and reinforced my passion for building captivating games.


### Continuous Learning
In September 2022, I took my dedication to learning to the next level by enrolling at 42 School. This intensive learning experience exposed me to a wide range of programming languages. This diverse curriculum equipped me with a versatile skill set, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with confidence.
